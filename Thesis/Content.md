Einleitung zur Position und Fachbereich

Even though the results of this thesis can hopefully be applied all over the world, the foundation and especially the examination of the evolution of images, language and writings are mainly from an central European standpoint and therefore highly curated and partial.

## Derivation

Visual communication is essential in every aspect of our lives. Newborns first learn to connect basic visual cues such as shapes and colours to rudimental meanings. The mother’s smile and the fire’s glowing appearance gain meanings, that — amount countless others – guide us through an world dominated by visual information. These fundamental lessons determine our cognitive development more than the four other senses that we experience from our surroundings. Only after we internalise the interpretation of myriad visual impressions, we learn to express these things in words.

Words – first spoken, later written – have leverage mankind’s evolution. With the ability to reference objects, express intentions, or describe relations we gained the ability to communicate abstract systems and ideas with others. This development — starting with visual cues, the addition of spoken words and finally the expression of these words in (visual) writings — is something not only developed by humankind over the course of thousands of years but also run through by every child nowadays. These informations are stored in our long term memory stores that enable us to rapidly identify words and thousands of visual objects. (Ware, S. 367)

Observing this development it is important to note, that these forms of expression and impression are highly connected and never exclusive. The development of language and writing/reading are greatly influenced by each other and were initially inspired by the actual physical appearance. The Egyptologist Jan Assmann interprets writings by the Philosopher Moses Mendelssohn about this development as follows: The first step was an »iconic turn«. From the things itself to images of the things. Mendelssohn exemplifies this through the symbol of a majestic lion that gained its meaning from the actual lion. The second step is an »uniconic turn«, in which these symbols detach from their original reference objects and become words. (Assmann 2002) René Magritte’s »The Treachery of Images« (»La Trahison des images«) illustrates this relationship between the signifier (signifiant) and the signified (signifié). The writing »This is not a pipe.« (« Ceci n’est pas une pipe. ») advises the beholder that the image she is seeing is not a pipe but instead the image of a pipe. The painting (signifier) is not capable of showing an actual object (signified), but rather — as Platon describes it — the idea. Furthermore the »lapidary truth of the sentence and the non less lapidary evidence of the illustration possess no common level. What we *truly* see, is not said in the linguistic statement in any way. What we truly *read*, is not confirmed by the eye. (Boehm, 2014) The two signifier – image and writing – are competing each other. The once visually inspired language emancipated itself to abstract words.

Today two forms of »word-writings« can be generally distinguished: Pictorial and alphabetical systems (Frutiger, 1998, S. 114). The Chinese characters for example have great amount of signs, whose appearance is directly derived from the pictorial representation of an object. Their form is motivated from their original form.** Note: ShaoLan Hsueh’s Chineasy takes advantage of this by embedding the symbols into graphics and thus helping people to learn the signs.**In contrast alphabetical characters can no longer be assigned to semantic meanings on their own. Even though they have a »hieroglyphic memory«, their form became arbitrary. (Assmann, ???) Instead they represent tones, which gain meaning in their sequence.

In Europe the ability to write words with these »building blocks« pave the way to Gutenberg’s milestone invention of the letterpress. Instead of writing letters one by one to a single book, a composing galley is prepared once with movable types and can then be used to print multiple copies. While manuscripts have always leverage the spread of knowledge, with the development of letterpress the book could finally break open this bottleneck of dissemination of knowledge, where one friar could manufacture one book during his lifetime. Through it was an revolution on two levels: the rising availability of affordable, transportable, and uniform knowledge and the first serial production from the economical perspective. (Hausmann, 2009)

The book’s status influenced communication and the dissemination of knowledge so drastically, that the Canadian philosopher of communication theory Marshall McLuhan declares the book as the leading medium of recent times. The fact, that the »Times« magazine declared the German blacksmith as the most important person of the last millennium (Hausmann, 2009), support McLuhan’s term of the »Gutenberg Galaxy«. This term describes the great effects the book had not only on social interaction and conditions, knowledge transfer and research, alphabetisation and language standardisation, but also on the thinking itself. Thinking and designation were directly referring each other before the domination of the book. With the optical fixation the ** language** crowds between these two. (Assmann, 2002) The reading of sequenced letters, words and paragraphs demands and facilitates linearity in contrast to spatiality, discourse in favour of simultaneous recognition and capacity for abstraction instead of affectivity. (Assmann, 2002)

These effects were recognised as the »linguistic turn«, in which language as a medium of recognition and description of reality was critically studied. Ludwig Wittgenstein summarises this deliberations with the limits of his language as the limits of his world (*Quelle*). This reveals how human’s devotion from images to language also implicates their comprehension and expression. This has been researched as »Linguistic relativity« first by Wilhelm von Humboldt, later by Benjamin Lee Whorf and Edward Sapir, whose work is now summed up under the term Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. Research in this area has been done by Berlin and Kay (1969) and Eva Heller, who specified this analysis for colour designation and perception. (Heller, 2004)

Today the end of the Gutenberg Galaxy is discussed in various fields. The world shaped and controlled by electronic technology is »imploding« (McLuhan 2004, 101), the sender-receiver model is outdated and image generating media is becoming ubiquitous. Norbert Bolz exemplifies this with the rising use of photographs in newspapers: While many traditional newspapers rejected images for a long time not because of technical reasoning but rather conservatism, purely textual newspaper are unthinkable nowadays. (Bolz, 2013)

But mass media is not the only field affected. In opposition to the linguistic turn the iconic turn was formulated in the 1990s. While the actual definition is still not finalised, it circulates around questions in a world more and more dominated by images and image technologies. (Bachmann-Medick, 2008) William Mitchell and Gottfried Boehm individually described and analysed the process with different terms and perspectives. Both the pictorial- (Mitchell) and iconic-turns (Boehm) emphasise the importance of images not only as references to objects but also as objects of analysis itself. (Bachmann-Medick, 2008) Even though the linguistic turn considered this impossible, this leads to not only thinking *about* images, but rather to thinking *with* images. (Bachmann-Medick, 2008)

But this newly formed visual culture (Bildwissenschaften) does not want to replace the previously proclaimed linguistic turn, but rather describe the »image as another way of thinking«. (Boehm, 2007, S. 27) Prominent examples of analysis in this discipline is the use of images to »display« (»Sichtbarmachung«) enemies in so called »enemy images« (»Feindbilder«) (Kittsteiner, 2004) and use of photographs as »witnesses« for the Holocaust. (Didi-Huberman 2006) In contrast in the book »Cosmigraphics: Picturing Space Through Time« Michael Benson analysis the view of the world in images through history.

While these examples refer to the displayed content of images, another object of research is the figurative, graphical level. Even though this field has been known and used by painters and photographers for a long time, recent fundamental researches especially in psychology opened up the field of perceptual psychology. Mostly evolutionary reasoned humans perceive visual informations on different levels. In the beginning of humankind, survival depended on quick and profound decisions. Danger needed to be spotted quickly and food needed to be identified correctly. The human’s brain adapted to this factors with various *visual* pattern recognition pattern, which base on basic visual forms. We search for useful possibilities for action and vision allows us to »perceive affordances of the environment directly, not indirectly by piecing together evidence from our senses.« (Ware, S. 18)

These recognition skills can be still used today: The colour red still represents danger and creates attention (Heller, 2002), moving objects could become a threat and occupy our alertness (Ware, S. 362), and bigger (closer) objects seem more important. (Lidwell, ???) In fact the Gestalt principles (Prof. Dejan Todorovic, 2008) are based on our evolutionary shaped perception.

Completely based on this figurative and graphical level is the especially in recent time widely used discipline of visualization. These abstract images utilise basic graphical forms to communicate information. Information that could not or only with high difficulties be communicated through language or even »concrete« images. While graphics, which are nowadays labeled as visualizations or information graphics, were already created in the last century, computers accelerated the creation of these »mathematical« images. Bar charts, pie charts or scatterplots became known to the general public through software like Microsoft Excel.

Apart from the general public a community of experts, consisting mainly of designers, mathematicians, statisticians and computer scientist push the limits of this multidimensional data mapping. Computer driven graphics and scientific environments move the discipline further away from non-experts. While some great graphics make it into popular media, visualization still remains far behind its potentials. Just like newspaper rejected photographs in the beginning, knowledge mediator remain with Gutenberg’s legacy in favour of visualization.

At this point my thesis starts. I want to move visualizations away from its expert driven presence to everyday life. For this my approach is to position graphics right at the point were currently still the most knowledge is imparted: in the written text. And while many realisations present a divided back and forth between graphic and text, my approach is quite literally by breaking up the boundaries between each medium. My goal is to create Boehm’s »union of power« (»Herrschaftsunion«) between the linguistic and the iconic turn to create a fertile juxtaposition instead of opposite positions. (Doris Bachmann-Medick, 2008)

## Entwicklung einer präzisen Fragestellung
### Überlegungen
#### Entwicklung einer präzisen Fragestellung
**How can micro visualizations enhance text comprehension, memorability and exploitation?**

Text and Visualization should be used together. Through the course of this work I discuss why neither visualization nor text should replace each other and why typography is already one form of visualization. This analysis leads to a combination of these disciplines and to my reasoning why this »union« is best realised through »micro visualizations«. For this I briefly introduce the terms.

##### What is communication?

Communication is everything. But what is good communication? Humankind has developed a wide variety of communication channels, ranging from body language and spoken language over to written and printed type, and finally to electronically processed communication. Each of this steps marked a milestone in mankind’s history, but none could completely replace previous mediums. Even though some of the utilised technology for each channel might have been replaced over time, the basic concept of communication stayed preserved.
There are two reasons for that: First, every form of communication has its own advantages and applications at different settings, and second, each development rests upon the former one and therefore relays on this common understanding.
To emphasise this relation even further Paul Watzlawick’s famous quote »One cannot not communicate« (*Quelle*) expands the definition of what communication is and implicates that at least one of these channels is always active. It also facilitates the theory of multi-layered communication and thus that a single form of expression is seldom and a single form of impression is impossible. The following example illustrates this: When one reads a text, one is not just reading. The written, printed or displayed words are only one part of the information that is received. The material, the layout and the many aspects of typography all communicate on their own and through influence how and what information is perceived from the actual text.

### What is Typography?

The importance of the appearance of the text is well known and generations of type designers and typographers developed a variety of techniques to design and enhance the »text-seeing« and reading process. Even before books were printed a highly elaborated discipline had formed around type design. Today typography is an inherent part in design education. The variety of type design principles and typographic variables need to be thoughtfully applied to the text to comply with the content but also to be understood by the reader. Some of these principles are conventions, which evolved over time – italic and regular fonts –, others are based on fundamental decision like reading from one side in one direction – flush left, justified or centered text –, while others base on perceptional reasoning – font size and weight.

Carried by this unique craft, written and later – with Gutenberg’s invention – printed books came to their prominent status they hold today. But the importance of typography is not justified by the decoration of the text, but rather the readability of the text and more fundamentally by the supportive character the design plays *for* the content of the text. Robert Bringhurst exemplifies this for the typeface: »When the type is poorly chosen, what the words say linguistically and what the letters imply visually are disharmonious, dishonest, out of tune.« (Bringhurst, S. 23) To clarify, honour or disguise the content is seen an the most important role typography plays. But with the leverage its application has, it can also be misused: »In a world rife with unsolicited messages, typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read.« (Bringhurst, 2012, S. 17) This implies what consequences typographic decisions have on the visual appearance and hence on the very first impression the reader has of the text. With other words: »Type is persuasive – and thus so is typography […]« (Jason Santa Maria, S. 13)

Besides the used material, the selection of an appropriate typeface is the first and fundamental decision when approaching a text. With the selection of one typeface the designer takes over many decisions, that were previously made by the type designer. It may also demand a certain typographic application to suit its appearance. But the explanation of this would would go beyond the scope of this study. What is relevant for this thesis is the great impact just the choosing of a typeface has for the perception of the text.

Further »tools«, that are available for the typographers are for example margin, line-height, letter-spacing or letter case. A full exploration of these variables is discussed in relation to »visualization« further down.

#### What is Visualization?
The power of photographs has been used for a long time. As mentioned above nearly every newspaper relays on the impact a photograph can have for a story. But with this practice arises problems with the photographibility of certain subjects. (Bolz) Intangible and abstract problems cannot draw much attention to itself, because they can not be captured in a photograph or illustration. This becomes even more apparent in context of social media, where posts with images reach higher click rates. One answer to these undepictable subjects are visualizations, which encode abstract data into tangible graphics. Thus visualization are used for information **explanation**.
Visualization is not a new field, but experienced an upturn in recent time. With abstract data becoming ubiquitous the challenge to make sense of this new resource became apparent in all industries. The term big data arised in the hope to find previously hidden insights from the analysis of great amounts of data. Besides statistical methods, visualization is another promising and proven approach. For this purpose data visualization are used for **exploration**.
While the textual analysis of such an amount of data is not efficient, humans are very good at spotting pattern, abnormalities or trends on a visual level. (Few, 2010) Ware goes even further and says »There is no other way of presenting information so that structures, groups, and trends can be discovered among hundreds of data values.« (Ware, S. 225)

Bolz speaks in this context about the concision (Prägnanz) of an image. This quality enables us to instantly *see* the content. (Bolz) In order to understand this process the human sensory system needs to be examined. »The term sensory system includes all phenomena, that manifest themselves in the consciousness as result of stimulation of any sensory organ« (Haverkamp, 2009, S. 41) This rather broad definition describes (all) the phenomena as something, which is actively manifesting itself. This seems to be opposed to the widely established and accepted concept of constructivism.

The term constructivism how we perceive our surroundings. In philosophy, anthropology and psychology – in contrast to constructivism in art – it describes the following process: When we observe objects we reconstruct these as mental objects. These »ideas« – as Platon called them – are constantly matched to previous experience and influences. These »images« of objects work as prototypes and can be recalled even with difference appearance or after perspective transformation. (Ware, 230) This implicates, that the human brain is no longer passive in its perception, but instead active in terms of selection, projection, interpretation and sense-giving: he constructs his world individually (Maletzke, S. 127)
This obviously raises question regarding the »real reality«. Concepts of mass communications are no longer consistent with this theory. Every human needs to be viewed as an individual, from whom consistent reactions can no longer be expected. But this rather philosophical discussion is beyond the scope of this work.
What is relevant for the purpose of this work and for the perception of visualization is the active selection and interpretation of the presented image. But what is equally important and scientifically proven as well is the »passive« perception of visual information. The answer to this seemingly contradiction lays in the way our visual sensory system works. Simplificated it consists of three stages: Parallel Processing, Pattern Perception, and Sequential Goal-Directed Processing. In the first stage »billions of neurons work in parallel, extracting features from every part of the visual field simultaneously. This parallel processing proceeds whether we like it or not, and it is largely independent of what we choose to attend to […].« (Ware, …, S. 21) This is one reason humans are good at comprehending large amounts of data points in short time. The parallel, rapid processing explains why visual information can be extracted quicker form graphics than from textual presentations. »At the second stage, rapid active processes divide the visual field into regions and simple patterns, such as continuous contours, regions of the same colour, and regions of the same texture.« (Ware, …, S. 22) Important to note is, that at this stage the information is handled in serial, resulting in a much slower processing. At this point the long-term memory is already involved. In the third stage »we construct a sequence of visual queries that are answered through visual search strategies.« (Ware, S. 22) What this means is the active search for visual elements that fit the given task. For example this could consist of connecting close located red points. The last two stages involve this active search, selection and interpretation of the given visual information, whereby it is important to note, that this »active« process is still processed mainly unconsciously. »Consider the eyeball as an information-gathering searchlight, sweeping the visual world under the guidance of the cognitive centers that control our attention. Information is acquired in bursts, a snapshot for each fixation. From an image buffer, the massively parallel machinery of early visual processing finds objects based on salient features of images.« (Ware, S. 145)

In order to help spotting these salient features data visualists should encode these informations to »pop out«. Various studies analysed which encoding works best for which type of data type. The first and most cited taxonomy of such kind was formulated by Jacques Bertin. In his book Semiology of Graphics (Semiologie Graphique), published in 1967, the cartographer constrains his studies some factors like printable, standard sized graphics on white paper. His work was later picked up by many scientists and expanded by unnoticed variables and ones that were left out intentionally, as he is backgrounded in cartography.

Bertin distinguishes seven forms of encoding. He describes these as »visual variables«, from which the designer can form the image to suggest perspective, reality, relationships or space. (Bertin, S. 42) These variables are: Position, size, value (opacity), texture, colour, orientation and shape. The position of an object along the x- and y-axis (the positioning in 3D spaces is slowly starting in the visualization community) was described as the most powerful. Powerful in a sense, that the human’s perception can most easily decode the information »behind« the data point. Also the comparison between multiple points can be easily accomplished. This idea of effectiveness was then continued by Jock D. Mackinlay. He provided the sorting in relation to the given data type. These data type are »quantitative, ordinal and nominal«
::Quantitative data can be measured by the amount. This category can be distinguished once more between *interval* and *ratio*. Interval data sits between two (arbitrary) points like 0° and 100° for Celsius temperature or values on a ph-scale. Even when the gap between the two values can be measured,  50° C is not twice as hot as 25° C. Instead this ratio can calculated for the number of people (1, 2, 13), or the weight of an object (1pound, 14kg). These values can be also measured as discrete (3µm) or continuous data (10.3m).::
::Ordinal data can not be measured quantitatively but instead in ordered categories. For example in a race the gap between the *first* and the *second* place might not be the same as the gap between the *third* and *fourth* place , or half *good* is not *bad*. Quantitative data can be converted to ordinal data, but ordinal data cannot – without further information – be converted to quantitative data.::
::Nominal data is is also categorised, but without any order and hence often referred to as qualitative. For example *male* is not better than *female*, *Hindu*, *Muslim* or *Lutheran* are equal, and also blood type like A, B, 0 or AB are not ordered in any way.::

### Typography as visualization
When comparing the visual variable Bertin defined with basic techniques used in typography one can see, that these match in most cases in their implementation and effect. But some major points need to be considered:
- In Typography there are even more visual variables available due to conventions like underlaying or line-height.
- The application even depends if is applied to the whole paragraph, the sentence, the word, or the letter.
- On the other side some of the »typographic variable« cannot be used without compromises on the legibility.
- Also the initial situation is different since in »normal« visualization each object represents one data point. When applying visualization to some words or text elements, the others words act as »normal« for comparison.
- The modification of any of the typographic variable influences the grey value (the precepts blackness from a distance) of the text. Sometimes this is not intended. The change of the typeface might hence not only have a semantic alteration but also an visual effect.
The table illustrates the typographic instruments for each form of encoding.

### Position
The repositioning can cause issues on the readability. Each letter, word, sentence and paragraph has an inherent position, that is crucial for the content. The variance of the position is therefore limited and needs to be applied carefully. Letters and words are especially bind to their position. While the shift in x-position is not recommended, the shift in y-position is already common typographic practise. For example chemical, physical or mathematical notations use a shift for sub- and superscript to create a hierarchy between characters. What is important to note here, is that because of the little possibilities of variation within the line height, the visualization becomes categorical or discrete rather than continuous. The comparison is also difficult across multiple lines. As …(Taxonomie) describe, objects with a common baseline are easier to collate. This also limits the modified amount of characters to keep the baseline within a line row. The shift on the x-axis of sentences or paragraphs is already used. Lists in table of contents for example use different positions to indicate its hierarchy. Again a modest execution should be applied to display both categorical or quantitative data. Another problem that could cause a lack of comparison on the y-axis is the different size of the letters. The ascenders and descender suggest different starting points. It is therefore recommended to use capital letters, to work with the same letter height.
A unique variable is the text alignment like flush left, justified or centered text. Many office programs take advantage of this by aligning text on the left side, while numbers are aligned on the right side of the cell.

### Size
The use of size to indicate value is already common practise. Headlines, sub-headlines, body text and foot notes often use different font-sizes to indicate hierarchy. But just like with the positioning letters, words, sentences and so on have a inherent value: Words with more letters are longer, capital letters are usually higher than lowercase letters. This is same problem as with maps: As countries with a greater landmass appear to be more important, »bigger« words seem to be more important. This problem can be often seen with »word clouds«, that scale words for example in regard to their appearance. It is advisable to use words with the same letter length whenever possible. As mentioned above capital letters can also help to have an even initial size. Obviously the size should have an minimum value in order to maintain readability. But this might also be a problem: When the zero-point is at some minimum text size, the comparison can become difficult, because this minimum size needs to be subtracted from the total size. Summarised one should use the size when comparison does not need to be exact and when none of the underlaying data falls below value that would result in unreadable text size.
Besides the scaling of the words, the size could be applied to the width or height of the »paragraph box«. When the text is long enough, the text boxes can imitate the usage of bar charts, where the line-length corresponds to the value.

### Value
The use of value (opacity or saturation) may also cause problems for the legibility. Just like objects that do not stand out from the background are hard to spotted, text the is too similar to the background cannot be read anymore. All changes of value or colour should be stressed on lightweight fonts to counteract the small surface area.

### Color
The colour hue of an word can be used to indicate value nearly just like for normal graphical elements. The only restriction is given when the readability is faulted. Because black font on a white background is so common, one could use this for advantage by using colours to empathise certain values. It is also advisable to use multi-hue diverging colour palettes (Aisch, Mastering Multi-hued Color Scales with Chroma.js, 2013) since the relatively small surface area of the font might restrain the conception of diverse colours.

### Texture
The application of a texture highly depends on the type of texture. Normally the fonts surface is smaller than typical objects with textures like countries on a map. This can result in either an unidentification of the actual texture or an illegibility of the word.

### Orientation
Different orientations can hardly be used without compromises on the text flow. While complete sentences or paragraphs can be read with varying slopes, letters or words should not be rotated within sentences.

### Shape
The shape of the letters cannot be mapped directly to a single typographical variable. There are multiple options to vary the font’s shape. The most radical would be the actual typeface. This categorical alternation should be treated with caution. Two major concerns need to be taken care of: The distinction of different typefaces can be hard for the laymen. Serif, sans-serif, script, blackletter and decorative fonts might easily distinguished, but within these categories non-specialists could hardly separate Renaissance, Baroque or Neoclassical. Another thing to be concert of is the inherent cultural association of that font. Blackletter fonts are commonly (and falsely) associated with the Third Reich, serif fonts with the traditional and script fonts with an humanly touch.
Another way to alternate the shape of an font is either the its case (lowercase or uppercase) or its style: italic (and rarely left oblique), small caps and roman. This has been common practice since the sixteenth century (Bringhurst, S. 102). This feature can only be used categorical since there is normally no option of more or less italic.
The third option is to use different font-weights. Depending on the amount of fonts the typeface consists of, the font weight is a feasible variable to visualise information. The weight of the font also influences the grey value of the text accordingly and is therefore – just like the colour value – able to communicate its value from first sight.
Another option is the width of the fonts. Some typefaces consists of extra fonts like condensed, narrow/compressed or extended. These fonts could be equally used as different weights, but since they are rather seldom real world applications would be rare.
One great possibility would be Multiple Master fonts. These font can continuously interpolate between two »masters«. Possible axes can be weight, width, optical size and even style. With this technique individual interstage can be generated. Unfortunately MM fonts could not establish itself. Recent developments on this topic are JavaScript-based solutions like Plumin.js, which allows to generate/manipulate fonts with JavaScript code. Prototypo is another approach which allows font manipulation with type designers variables like x-height, capital height, ascender and descender height, slant, overshoot, crossbar position or width. Opentype.js even allows to directly manipulate anchor points. All this tools could potentially be used for visualization with continues interstates to represent values. The disadvantage of all these tools is the purely mathematical generation of the fonts. The perception of letters and thus their design is not linear which often leads to unpleasant results when simply generating fonts.

### Additional typographical variables
Over the course of hundreds of years typographic conventions established, which are unique in graphical distinction. These are often additional graphical elements, that can distinguish words. For example the underlining of a word is clearly stressing that word, while underlining a rectangle would not be directly understood as highlighted. With the distribution of the internet the underlining of text became an functional, semantic meaning: being a hyperlink. Especially in combination with blue or purple text colour the association is nearly universal.
The highlighting of text passages also work with characters at the beginning and end. This way markup languages *highlight* words or declare <div>boxes</div> of content.

### Conclusion
Summarised typographic variables contain parallels visualisation variables and hence can be used as such. In consideration of the legibility typographic distinctions can also be used to visualise data. While the position is widely regarded as the best way to encode in »normal« visualizations it needs special treatment with text. »Weaker« visualization variables like colour appear to be more useful because firstly they do not displace the text corpus and secondly allow for comparison across multiple text lines. Typographic convention can also be taken advantage of, but need to be treated with respect for cultural inherent meanings.

### Why stick to text?

With this seemingly solution to all modern problems, the question arises, why one should stick to text. The answer to this is based on the cultural imprint by the book. As previous stated it had an tremendous effect on not only how knowledge is distributed but also in the way we think. Habits formed conventions and today most people are used to the obtain information from written text with its discursiveness, linearity and abstraction. Mendelssohn bewails what this has done with humans: »We teach and instruct one another only through writings; we learn to know nature and man only from writings. We work and relax, edify and amuse ourselves through scribbling. The preacher doesn’t talk to his congregation; he reads or recites to it something he has written. The teacher reads his written lectures from the podium. Everything is dead letter; the spirit of living conversation has vanished. […] This has brought it about that man has almost lost his value for his fellow-man. We don’t try to meet with the wise man because we find his wisdom in ·his· writings. […] In short, we are literati, men of letters.« (Jonathan Bennett by Moses Mendelssohn: Jerusalem – Religious Power and Judaism, 2011)
(»Wir lehren und unterrichten einander nur in Schriften; lernen die Natur und die Menschen kennen nur aus Schriften; arbeiten und erholen, erbauen und ergötzen uns durch Schreiberei; der Prediger unterhält sich nicht mit seiner Gemeinde, er liest oder deklamiert ihr eine aufgeschriebene Abhandlung vor. Der Lehrer auf dem Katheder liest seine geschriebenen Hefte ab. Alles ist toter Buchstabe, nirgends Geist der lebendigen Unterhaltung. […] Daher ist es gekommen, dass der Mensch für den Menschen fast seinen Wert verloren hat. Der Umgang des Weisen wird nicht gesucht; denn wir finden seine Weisheit in Schriften. […] Mit einem Worte, wir sind litterati, Buchstabenmenschen.«) (M. Mendelssohn: Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum. In: ders.: Schriften über Religion und Aufklärung, hg. von M. Thom, Darmstadt 1989, S. 421f.)

Even though I do not to want people to turn away from books as Mendelssohn text might suggest, but rather stress how many fields are framed by the book. Even today where the production of images is effortless as never before, text does not disappear. Instead new forms of text »types« evolve: Comic books, Instant Messaging and Twitter. Instead of the pessimistic view of some writers, we should utilise this tools for they are still forms of expression based on textual communication.
While some describe the printed book as the »perfect reading machine« (…) I personally see much potential for new forms of printed books, but even more for interactive, responsive, illustrative ebooks or any form of textual expression.

For this thesis I would like use the prominent status of the text and enhance the its comprehension through the combination with visualizations.

### Why combine?

These two disciplines – typography and visualization – are too often treated as two separated things. 
Both act as visual variables that are applied according to the underlaying data. Where typography adds this data level to the text, visualization works with graphical elements to create communicate the data.

Scott McCloud illustrates in the book »Reading Comics« that words and images are two ends on a scale from concrete to abstract. (McCloud, …) He also illustrates how these two ends can interact with one and another, each fulfilling its own purpose. Applying this to previous considerations, that typography is to text, what visualisation is to graphics, one can say that these should *also* be considered as two ends on one scale. Just as comics work with both images and text to tell a story, this thesis shows how text can be enriched with data-driven typography and visualisation to tell a story.
Scientifically the combination of images and words has been studied by a number of studies. Most of the results support the theory of »dual coding« by Mayer et al. (1999). »They suggest that if active processing or related material takes place in both visual and verbal cognitive subsystems, learning will be better.« (Ware, S. 306) The use of both channels is claimed to have an higher efficiency than single-channel encoding. One aspect, that is crucial for this effect and also for the concept of this thesis, is the connection between these two levels. That supports the decision to directly integrate the visualization inside the text to provide this kind of link. Obviously this link between needs to be explicit in order connect corresponding elements. (Ware, S. 307)
One study, that followed this thesis’ approach from the other side is by Chandler and Sweller (1991), examined the integration of text directly inside graphics. Their test graphic – an diagram with operating instructions – had text snippets directly placed at the relevant point. Their successful experiment was justified by the »limited-capacity working memory«. »They argue that when the information is integrated, there is a reduced need to store information temporarily while switching back and forth between locations.« (Ware, S. 307) It may be expected that this concept performs in the same way with images supporting text.
Another reason, why the combination of these two provide additional insight, lays in the frequently given reasoning for visualization. For this the Anscombe's quartet is often used. After presenting tables with numbers, visualizing the same numbers in diagrams seems obvious and convenient. And indeed it is much easier to compare, spot trends, and patterns with diagrams. But one thing is often neglected: The table »expresses ￼[…]￼ values precisely and it provides an efficient means to look up values for a particular […]« dimension. (Few, ???) For some graphics the underlaying data might even not be extractable at all. For most applications that is absolutely valid: The more data points you have, the less important the single one becomes. But what should be taken from this is, that both »visualizations« – table and graphic – have a unique quality, which are advisable for different settings. The same holds true for text. *Departments too often adhere to their medium: Journalists to text, financiers to tables, designers to graphics. Each discipline should more often use the adequate presentation for the message. Or as this thesis shows: A combination.*

## Why micro?

The combination of text and visualization can be approached from many directions. Besides the aim to create a balance between the two, the focus could be either on the verbal or on the graphical side. For this thesis I will focus on text with visualizations embedded. There are three reasons for that:
- Based on the previously discussed considerations on the history of communication I have come to believe that text is still human’s main medium of knowledge impartation. Even without graphical visualizations, but purely typographical visualizations the research in this field would be valuable.
- In regard to the first point I believe that an adduction to visualization for the general public could be best achieved with simple graphics embedded right into the familiar medium. The simplification is the first step to make them accessible to a broader audience.
- Previous research on the field of visualization has been mostly towards complex, data-rich graphics. (Visualisierung zu Micro Visualisierung!!!)
With the embedding and subordination of the graphics requirements towards their appearance arise. They need to be physically small, reduced in data points or/and in the number of dimensions. This reduction will be called »micro« in the course of this thesis. Thus I propose a wider understand of visualization. Every form of informational motivated visually alteration or addition is to be treated as visualization, even if it visualises a single data point.

One requirement I impose for the text is the retaining of its readability as text corpus.

#### Begründung der Relevanz des Themas:
With all the proven benefits of visualizations, they are still limited in their usage to a small elite.
- Gutes Funktionieren von Grafik ist bereits bewiesen (*Alberto, …*)
- Text als Hauptinformationsquelle weiterhin nutzen; beim gewohnten Medium bleiben (*Perfekte Leseschaschine*, *Bolz: Prägnanz*)
- Gerade die Zeit: Pictoral turn (Flusser)

#### gesellschaftliche, technologische Problemstellung
While the unreflected utilisation of Powerpoint charts can be found in nearly every presentation, supporting visualizations are nearly

Three main reasons:
1. Neue Möglichkeiten nutzen
2. Daten werden wichtiger (Singular/Plural)
3. Kategorisierung überkommen (Kontext schaffen)

Technology demands redesign
The design of the book has not changed much in the last 500 years. Now with the emergence of new technology the text layout is no longer restricted to the classical design. Indeed new digital letterpress cannot be designed in the same way analog letterpressed books are designed. Varying reading environments, distances and behaviour  
%% Besides this adaptation to new reading behaviour  

Languages know only two forms to express the amount of an noun: singular and plural. For many centuries the possible value of any noun did rarely overtook a certain amount. The processable information was limited; the total quantity of for example population, transferred money or traveled distances did not reach such tremendous values. But today the plural form commonly presents values ranging from two to one hundred billion, that it might be time to find a new form of quantitative expression beyond the prefixed number.

Languages facilitates labelling. (Drucker)

- Photographibility (Bolz). Visualisierungen können Dinge zeigen, die Fotos nicht zeigen können. (Paper, Visual Turn)
- Visualisierungen werden häufig unreflektiert verwendet (Albertos Präsentation und Buch)
- Trennung von Texten und Grafiken
- Informationsüberflutung (*Quelle?*)
- Kontext der Informationen wird wichtiger (*Quelle?*)
- Technik getriebene Grafiken. Die Technik verleitet zu immer komplexeren Grafiken
- Das Buch bietet neue Möglichkeiten, die für das Verständnis genutzt werden können (Interaktivität, Verlinkung)
- Dies wird auch schon gemacht: iA-Reader (*Responsive Typography Artikel*), Webtypography, interaktive Schulbücher (*Apple*)
- Daten werden immer wichtiger: Daten-Range geht immer weiter auseinander: Singular und Plural reicht nicht mehr aus.

#### gestalterische Problemstellung
- Wie können Micro-Visualisierungen in den Text eingebettet werden? Stichwort: Lesefluss (*Typojournal?*)
- Typografie als eindimensionale Daten-Visualisierung
- Reflektierte Verwendung von Typografie-Variabeln und einfachen Visualisierungsvariabeln
- Das Interface auflösen (*Quelle?*)

This approach not only demands consideration towards technical and social aspects but also the examination of design methods. With the elaborated discipline of typography any modification of the layout needs to be considered in regard of the reading experience and flow. Important questions to ask are:
- »How does the form and the position of the graphics inside the text influence the habitual reading behaviour?« and
- »Which typographic variables can one already use to communicate additional information?«

The blending of these disciplines… 

#### (persönliche) Motivation für die Arbeit; Erkenntnisinteresse des Verfassers/der Verfasserin
Having worked as an information designer for varying applications like journalism, public relations, travel guides, scientific research, and art, I encountered mainly two perspectives on information visualization: One uses the text as an accessory part, the other considers visualizations as an accessory part.

### Überlegungen

The term »micro visualization« has not been used in this context before. Even a number of projects or concepts have been developed, which now fit into this scope, they have been compiled under this topic. The main inspiration and starting point for this considerations are Edward Tufte’s Sparklines. They follow the exact idea, this thesis is now pursuing: a small visualisation that is embedded right within the text corpus. Sparklines have been elaborated by Edward Tufte

## Durchführung der Forschung

### Überlegungen
#### In einem sozialwissenschaftlichen hermeneutischen Forschungsprozess werden sprachliche oder nichtsprachliche Handlungen (Texte, Bilder, Videos etc.) interpretiert, ohne Rekurs auf Gesetzeshypothesen.
#### Kennzeichnend für die hermeneutische Praxis ist die Bereitschaft, sich immer wieder von den Daten und den eigenen Deutungen irritieren zu lassen. Mit dieser Haltung ist es möglich, Neues zu entdecken, Felder zu explorieren, Perspektiven aufzuschließen etc.
