# The Incredible Convenience of Mathematica Image Processing

One of the most striking features of Galileo’s observations of Saturn’s rings was his use of images in place of words; the image became the language. And it appears that Wolfram Mathematica supports the same images-as-language view of the world, with interesting and even useful results:

In a nutshell: the image becomes an operand of the mathematical programming language at the heart of Mathematica. Galileo showed us how to talk to people with images as language for conveying science, and 400 years later people can use images as language in computational science.

Can simplified, programmatic mathematical analysis of telescope images be far behind?
