I just ran across this example of a symbol-as-noun inserted inline with text (see image attached). Interestingly, it is used here rather casually.

I wonder if the fact that this is an essay in comics scholarship led the author and the journal to use the symbol instead of words? **Or is it that we apparently don’t have a concise name for this object, other than the symbol of Venus, which some readers might not immediately get?**

Here’s the citation: Julie D. O’Reilly, “The Wonder Woman Precedent: Female (Super)Heroism on Trial,” Journal of American Culture 28.3 (2005): 273.

Here is a great example from contemporary publishing that integrates music notation directly into text. The rhythmic figures themselves appear as nouns in the excerpt below. Naturally, the audience for this book would be familiar with this music notation. The first two graphic images replace clumsy language such as “eighth‑note and dotted quarter‑note” and “dotted eighth note and sixteenth‑note tied to quarter‑note” respectively, with their music notation counterparts, right in the text itself.

Here is an example of Rockwell Kents illustrated work on Candides’ Voltaire. In 1928 the first book published under the then new Random House imprint was a Rockwell Kent illustrated edition of Candide.
See also his work on Moby Dick (http://www.fedpo.com/BookDetail.php?bk=232) that shows integration of line art and text.
